# EchoMEI Privacy Policy

## Overview

EchoMEI is a Chrome extension designed to simplify the extraction and management of MEI (Microempreendedor Individual) data from the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service. We take your privacy seriously and ensure that all your information is handled with the utmost care and protection.

## Data Collection

### Personally Identifiable Information

-   **CNPJ Numbers**: The extension collects CNPJ numbers entered by the user for the sole purpose of extracting MEI data from the Receita Federal.

### Location Information

-   **IP Address**: The extension may collect the user's IP address during the communication with the Takk Innovate Studio API. This is typically handled automatically and is not used directly by the extension.

## Data Usage

-   **Single Purpose**: The data collected is used exclusively for the purpose of extracting and displaying MEI data from the Receita Federal.
-   **Export Options**: Users have the option to export the extracted data to CSV or PDF formats for further analysis and record-keeping.

## Data Sharing

-   **No Third-Party Sharing**: EchoMEI does not sell or transfer user data to third parties outside of the approved use cases.
-   **No Unrelated Use**: The extension does not use or transfer user data for purposes unrelated to the extension's single purpose.

## Data Security

-   **Local Storage**: Data is stored locally in your browser and is not transmitted to any external servers beyond the Takk Innovate Studio API.
-   **Data Protection**: We employ best practices to ensure that the data you enter and view in the extension is protected against unauthorised access.

### Host Permissions

-   **Justification**: The host permission for `*://*.receita.fazenda.gov.br/*` is required for the extension to access and interact with the Receita Federal's pages, where CNPJ data is extracted.
